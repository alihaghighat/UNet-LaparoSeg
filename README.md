# 🔬 UNet-LaparoSeg – Endometriosis Segmentation from Laparoscopic Images

**UNet-LaparoSeg** is a deep learning model designed for localizing and segmenting endometriosis lesions in laparoscopic images. It features a custom UNet architecture enhanced with a ResNet34 encoder, ASPP, and attention gates. The system also provides Persian-language diagnostic reports and visualization overlays.

## 📊 Evaluation (Test Set)

| Metric     | Value   |
|------------|---------|
| Dice (macro) | 0.0666  |
| IoU (macro)  | 0.0243  |
| Recall       | 0.0385  |
| Sensitivity  | 0.3359  |
| Accuracy     | 0.7565  |

> ⚠️ These metrics reflect real-world challenges such as **class imbalance**, **visually subtle lesions**, and **small or irregular lesion shapes** – common in real-world laparoscopic imagery.
>
> 🔍 **Note:** High accuracy may be misleading due to dominance of background pixels. Metrics like **Dice**, **IoU**, and **Recall** are more meaningful for medical segmentation tasks.
