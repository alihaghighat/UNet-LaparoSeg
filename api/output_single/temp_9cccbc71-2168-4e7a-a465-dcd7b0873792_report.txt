ðŸ§¾ Segmentation Summary Report for 'temp_9cccbc71-2168-4e7a-a465-dcd7b0873792'
The AI model examined the laparoscopic image and identified the following endometriosis-related features:

ðŸ”¹ **Endo-Peritoneum**
   - Superficial peritoneal lesions suggestive of early-stage endometriosis were identified. These typically appear as small, pigmented patches on the peritoneal surface and may indicate subtle disease onset.

ðŸ”¹ **Endo-Ovary**
   - Ovarian abnormalities consistent with endometriomas (chocolate cysts) or post-inflammatory adhesions were detected. These findings may correlate with chronic pelvic pain and infertility.

ðŸ”¹ **Endo-TIE (Tubal/Intestinal Endometriosis)**
   - Deeply infiltrating lesions were observed in the tubal or intestinal regions, suggesting advanced endometriotic involvement. These lesions may penetrate beyond the serosa and involve adjacent pelvic organs.

ðŸ”¹ **Endo-Uterus**
   - Surface-level uterine abnormalities indicative of serosal endometriosis were found. This may reflect external infiltration without affecting the endometrium itself.
