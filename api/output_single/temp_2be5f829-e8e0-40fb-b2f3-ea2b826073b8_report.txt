ðŸ”¹ **Endo-Peritoneum**
   - Superficial peritoneal lesions suggestive of early-stage endometriosis were identified. These typically appear as small, pigmented patches on the peritoneal surface and may indicate subtle disease onset.

ðŸ”¹ **Endo-Uterus**
   - Surface-level uterine abnormalities indicative of serosal endometriosis were found. This may reflect external infiltration without affecting the endometrium itself.
